## 1) Outbreak dynamics of forest insect herbivores

Population irruptions (*i.e.*, outbreaks) by native forest insect herbivores are a leading cause of disturbance across forested landscapes. The extent and severity of these outbreaks, whether caused by sawflies, caterpillars, or bark beetles, are affected by both the long-term effects of climate and the short-term effects of fluctuating weather. As a result, outbreaks by forest are highly sensitive to climatic change.

Population irruptions (*i.e.*, outbreaks) by native forest insect herbivores are a leading cause of disturbance across forested landscapes. The extent and severity of these outbreaks, whether caused by sawflies, caterpillars, or bark beetles, are mediated by both the long-term effects of climate and the short-term effects of fluctuating weather. As a result, outbreaks by forest are highly sensitive to climatic change.
